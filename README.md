# Early Breast Cancer Detection Deep Learning



## Problem Statement

Utilizing low-dose X-rays of the breast, known as [mammograms](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/programs/screening-mammogram), can detect subtle abnormalities in breast tissue long before they become perceptible. Regular screening mammograms are essential for most women as they offer the most reliable means of early breast cancer detection, significantly improving treatment outcomes. Despite advancements, breast cancer remains a significant threat, with approximately [42,250](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html) women projected to succumb to it in the United States in 2024. To mitigate the risk of incorrect interpretations and missed cases, diverse deep learning techniques are being employed to develop systems capable of detecting breast cancer in mammograms. These systems aim to assist physicians in achieving early detection and prompt intervention.

## Executive Summary


### Project objective
The project aims to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) system to aid radiologists in interpreting mammograms [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017177). Although CADx systems for mammography are not currently approved for clinical use, this study seeks to reduce false-positive rates and facilitate the evaluation of decision support systems.

## Conclusion and Improvement

In this study, an extensive examination of mammogram data and images is conducted, utilizing a variety of deep learning models to mass and calcification mammography images for cancer detection. The investigation unveiled discrepancies in model performance between the training, validation and later on testify on testing images.

While certain models exhibited promising performance during the training phase, the CNN model demonstrated moderate accuracy, displaying slightly superior results in overall cancer detection across both calcification and mass images. However, the task was challenging due to the high resolution of the images, with dimensions exceeding 4000 pixels by 4000 pixels. Initially, preprocessing involved resizing the images to *224x224*, which led to a decrease in accuracy due to pixel loss. Subsequently, adjustments were made to reshape the images to *512x512*, resulting in a modest improvement in accuracy, albeit not significantly.

Furthermore, when applying this model to testing images,  an F1 score of 0.416 for mass cases and 0.4 for calcification cases were achieved. While these results fall short of ideal for breast cancer detection, additional efforts were made to enhance images through the use of CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for preprocessing. This technique effectively increased the contrast of the images, potentially improving the model's ability to detect abnormalities.

Future improvement should prioritize the enhancement of mammography images to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable early detection of breast cancer. This can be achieved by implementing advanced image processing techniques such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Gamma correction, and other methods that enhance image contrast and clarity. Simultaneously, fine-tuning the parameters of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models is crucial, and leveraging pretrained models such as MobileNet can offer significant advantages. By integrating these approaches, future research can achieve substantial improvements in overall accuracy and facilitate earlier detection of breast cancer.
